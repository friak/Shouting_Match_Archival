## About the Game
I was inspired by the visceral expression of gamers when playing and watching competitive games, specifically fighting games in my experience. They shout, they cheer, they move. I wanted to bring that into Shouting Match where the game mechanic is the player’s expression. With this control scheme, players naturally fall into a fighting stance, and they can physically feel the power of their attacks through their own shouting. In addition, with the super moves mechanic, they can even fully embody the experience by having to move themselves in real life the same way as their character on-screen and unleash all their fighting spirit in the loudest shout they can give! Shouting Match is special in its way of bringing in traditional elements that make fighting games exciting—like fun characters, diverse move sets, and spectacular finishing moves—while also bringing out the alternative twist of having the player use their excitement to play the game itself.
